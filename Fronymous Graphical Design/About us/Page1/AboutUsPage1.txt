Welcome to Fronymous. We’re gad that you’re here and embarking on your journey of self-discovery with us. 

Here, we aren’t just passionate about mental health — we’re completely fascinated by it.
 
This project has been developed as a ‘Service to the Society’ i.e., it has been developed to contribute to the people in terms of Mental Health.

This project has been developed by our team of psyciatrists and psychologist, who have been providing therapy and counselling to patients on daily basis.

Most of the time, the patients are not so opened or clear about their thoughts, they appears as they are obscured or not expressed completely.
