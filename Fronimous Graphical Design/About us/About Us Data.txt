About fronimous
Welcome to Fronimous. We’re glad that you’re here and embarking on your journey of self-discovery with us.  
Here, we aren’t just passionate about mental health — we’re completely fascinated by it. 

Few years back it was not so common around to talk about mental health, but with rolling years, it has become a crucial aspect in our society.

Stil most of us can’t openly express what we are exactly facing or feeling, and it is totally human to be.

Our team of psychiatrists face these issues on daily basis, in our counselling session we try our best to ventilate patient’s thoughts. But mostly it appears as they are obscured or not expressed completely. 
Obviously, it can be hard to express or open one’s feeling to a stranger, so we resort to the “write and anecdotes” methods to get compeletly

As the experts staying up-to-date on the most recent insights that the industry has to offer, we sift through the science and provide you with only the most credible information validated by our medical review team. We use an evidence-based approach while keeping in mind that clinical research is only one piece of the puzzle. Real people are at the heart of our content, and we’re here to listen and learn from your lived experiences to make your voices heard.   Our goal is to help connect you with the guidance and support you need to help make meaningful changes that can benefit you in your real life. At Psych Central, we believe that exploring your mental health is less about identifying what’s “wrong” and more about fortifying your strengths and deepening your understanding of yourself and your needs.   But we understand that this process is a marathon, not a sprint. Whether this is your first time exploring your mental health options or you’ve been on this path with us since the beginning, we want to meet you where you are and let you know you’re not alone.   We’re here for you, and we’re here with you because you are at the center of what we do.
